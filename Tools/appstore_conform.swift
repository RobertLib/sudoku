//  Rewrites a finished App Preview into exactly the shape App Store Connect
//  accepts. The upload check is strict and its error messages are not: it
//  reports "unsupported or corrupted audio" for problems that have nothing to

//  Sudoku ships with no audio files — its sounds are synthesised at launch — so
//  the bed comes from Tools/gen_preview_music.py, a WAV, rather than from the
//  bundle. Anything else AVFoundation reads (m4a, caf, aiff) will do as well.
//  This file is the chess project's (github.com/RobertLib/chess), unchanged but
//  for the names and the frame grid below, which the chess one wants too — so a
//  fix in one belongs in the other.
//
//  Apple's specification (App Store Connect Help → App preview specifications):
//
//      resolution   iPhone 886 × 1920, iPad 13" 1200 × 1600 (portrait)
//      video        H.264 High Profile Level 4.0, progressive, 30 fps
//      bit rate     10–12 Mbps VBR
//      audio        stereo AAC, 256 kbps, 44.1 or 48 kHz — required
//      duration     15–30 s, at most 500 MB
//
//  Two things about that list are worth knowing, because both cost an upload to
//  find out. The native device resolution is *not* accepted — the one 886 × 1920
//  file is what Apple lists for every iPhone slot from 6.9" down to 6.1", and
//  the device's own 1242 × 2688 is not on the list — and Level 4.0 is a real
//  ceiling, so a preview at the device's own size comes out as Level 5.0 and is
//  refused. Silence does not satisfy the audio requirement either: AAC
//  compresses digital silence to about 2 kbps, two orders of magnitude under
//  the 256 kbps asked for, and a preview with no usable audio is treated as an
//  unsupported audio configuration. Hence the music bed — pass a file and it is
//  looped under the whole cut.
//
//  The picture is re-encoded, which it has to be to hit the profile and the
//  size. The final mux inserts both encoded tracks from time zero, so the video
//  comes out without the offset edit list a composed export carries; the audio
//  keeps the usual AAC priming edit (about 44 ms), which every AAC file has.
//
//  And every frame is put on an exact 30 fps grid — frame n at n/30 s, lasting
//  1/30 s, as many as the length asks for — because nothing upstream promises
//  it. A video composition renders a frame only where its source has one: when
//  the take's last change inside the cut comes a few frames before the cut's
//  end, the cut — and the composition output read here — stops those few
//  frames short, and closing the session at the cut's end stretched the last
//  one over the rest. One preview went up as 559 frames of 1/30 s and one of
//  1/6 s: 18.8 s long, and not 30 fps. So a frame the source does not have is
//  the one before it, repeated, and the last line checks the written file for
//  exactly that.
//
